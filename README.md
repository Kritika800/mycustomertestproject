customer friendly web feature made using html,css , javascript
The application has a home page where customers can start the design process by clicking a button.

When the button is clicked, the customer should be taken to a page where they can select the color and size of the t-shirt they want to design.

Once the customer selects the color and size, they should be taken to the design page where they can use a simple drawing tool to create their design.

The design tool should allow the customer to select different colors and brush sizes.

Once the customer is finished with their design, they should be able to save it to the database by clicking a “Save” button.
